# Homebrew formula for InfraPack. Lives in the tap repository
# github.com/Mostly-Works-Studio/homebrew-tap as Formula/infrapack.rb;
# scripts/release.sh fills in the version and sha256 and copies it there.
#
#   brew tap mostly-works-studio/tap && brew trust mostly-works-studio/tap
#   brew install infrapack
#
# Written to homebrew-core standards (source install, license, test block, no
# explicit version) so the same file can be submitted to Homebrew/homebrew-core
# once the project meets their notability bar.

    <<~EOS
      InfraPack needs Docker (Docker Desktop, OrbStack or Colima on macOS).
      Then:
        infrapack catalog            # what can be installed
        infrapack install postgres   # add one and start it
        infrapack open               # the web console
    EOS
  end

  test do
    assert_match version.to_s, shell_output("#{bin}/infrapack version")
  end
end
